# Review Project 
## Unit Testing, Inheritance, Streams and Collections

This week you learned about Unit Testing, Inheritance, Streams and Collections. 
This project is intended to help you solidify the concepts that you learned
throughout the week.

You will create a console application that is based on a card game of your choice.
Think about a card game that you like to play and create an application that takes you through
the flow of the game.

Your starter code includes a few classes that you may choose to use. You can modify them as
needed or you can even replace them with your own classes completely.

Attempt to use some of the new collections that we discussed in class this week.
Your first priority is to get your game to work correctly. You can alway modify
the code later if needed.


## Evaluation criteria and functional requirements

* The project must compile (it cannot have any build errors).
* Create a class and inheritance structure where appropriate
  * Depending on the type of card game you choose may determine if cards should use inheritance
* Write unit tests for your classes
  * The application flow and the user interface classes do not need Unit Tests
    (UnitTests are more difficult to write for these types of classes)
* Try to find code where Streams could simplify your code
* Consider using collections besides an ArrayList if possible (not required)
